"""
Helper module for category member processing.

This module encapsulates all logic related to collecting, merging, filtering,
and normalizing category members from various sources (API, SQL).

Responsibilities:
- Gathering members from API, SQL
- Deduplicating results
- Removing invalid entries and redirects
- Returning a clean, final list of category members
